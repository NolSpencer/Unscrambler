I first had to learn how to use python, as this was the first time I was learning or using python.
I then wrote down some pseudocode on how I would solve this problem.
I started working on how to convert this pseudocode to actual code.
Then I wrote the code, did a lot of bug testing, and figuring out easier ways to use the program.
